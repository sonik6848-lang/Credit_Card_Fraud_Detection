### 2️⃣ Credit Card Fraud Detection


# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📘 Overview
A machine learning project to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and popular ML libraries.  
The project uses real transaction datasets to train models and detect anomalies efficiently.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Detection of fraudulent transactions in unseen data  

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sonik6848-lang/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.git
2. Open Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
3.Run all cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results

## 📊 Results / Output
Fraud detection models with >95% accuracy on test data
Confusion matrices and ROC curves visualized
Insights into patterns of fraudulent transactions

##🧩 Key Learnings
Built end-to-end ML pipeline: data cleaning → model training → evaluation
Learned feature engineering techniques for fraud detection
Improved understanding of evaluation metrics for imbalanced datasets
